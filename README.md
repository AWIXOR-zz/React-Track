# React-Track

In the repo I'll try to show you my track learning react, showing my steps, and all react golden rules as I go with react this repo will be updated over time

# What is React js

React is a JavaScript library for building UIs. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

# History

_Some History won't hurt!_

before we talk about react we must talk a little about javascript and browsers.

Backing to 90s til 2000 we just have basic HTML CSS & JS -yup! thats also what we have today- but back then it simply started with simple forms. First the CLIENT (when he open an URL) makes a request TO THE SERVER, the server answers by sending all files (\*.HTML,\*.CSS,\*.JS)and when the user makes an action (clicks a link...), the CLIENT send that request back to the server, and the SERVER must send back all the files again, and so on!

this is how websites worked for years.

- 1993 : Mosaic 💥, the first web browser to start bringing the Internet to the mainstream but no JS ❌ yet. Onlt the DOM (Document Model Object)but non-standardized yet.
- 1994 : Netscape 🚀🚀🚀, was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share after the 1994, but by 2002 its use had almost disappeared.
- May 1995 : Java appeared, and Netscape wanted to add **interations** to the webpages.
- Mid 1995 : MOCHA was created by _Brendan Eich_ during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and [Self](http://www.selflanguage.org). Mocha syntactically was just like Java {curly bracket language}, but already contains many features that we know and love in modern JS.
- Sep 1995 : mocha's renamed to LiveScript and shipped in the first beta releases of [Netscape Navigator 2.0](https://tidbits.com/1995/11/13/netscape-2-0b2-available/).
- Dec 1995 : JavaScript name appeared, no longer LiveScript. This name was because back then java was the most popular programming language.
